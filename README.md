# GenEmulator ROMS Guide
this is the source code for the genemulator roms website you see in Ech0's Tapes Episode 1.

# How To OPEN

To run the project PROPERLY, you need to run a local dev server, which can be accessed in many ways.

Here's how to run the project the way I did:

1. Install Visual Studio Code.

Most of this is pure bread JavaScript and JSON. You need basic knowledge on both of those, AND a good IDE to work on. VSCode is the best FREE on you can get.
(for Ech0 Tapes devs: ask copilu on json stuff if you dont know)

2. Install the Five Server extension.

This is crucial for running a local developer server. Without it, you cannot even DISPLAY a line of text.

3. Open the PenguinMod Editor in your browser.

If you want, you can get a html copy or get (Desktop Penguin)[https://github.com/TheShovel/Desk-Penguin] if you have no internet.

well, actually, you couldn't use the pmp even if you wanted to anyway lol. all the extensions are fetched from a website.

4. Press "File", the "Load from your computer".

Load the PMP from the root directory.

5. Mess around

yes. dont replace the pmp here with your chopped one.


# HOW TO COMPILE

To compile, it's simple.

1. Press "File", then "Package project".
the rest should be pretty self explanatory.

if you are not familiar with the TurboWarp Packager then......

2. Extract the ZIP
3. Add the docs/ folder and the other files within the source code's root directory into the fodler where the compiled project remains.

**HOSTING A WEBSITE WHERE OTHERS CAN SEE IS ALL YOU.**
